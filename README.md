# Fashion Stocks Dashboard

# Description
This is a fashion stock information dashboard that fetches real-time stock data from an API and displays it interactively on the page. It includes features such as a stock list dropdown, real-time stock prices, and stock visualization charts. The dashboard is designed with a modern, responsive layout to ensure it works across various screen sizes.

# How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the project files and open the index.html file in your browser
2. Simultaneously, open the Alpha Vantage website, https://www.alphavantage.co/, to sign up for a free API key or use one of the seven premium API keys provided in class which are available in the class slack chat. Note: the code does not contain a hard-coded API key due to security reasons and as such the file will prompt you to manually load it when accessing the index.html. 
3. When prompted in your browser, enter the API key in the text box to allow you to interact with the features on the webpage.
4. Select one of the stocks in the dropdown and click the "lookup" button to view the stock information and visualization chart showing real-time stock prices.
